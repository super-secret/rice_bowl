## Framing

Opening:
"Please close your laptops. join me in taking a deep breath, in through the nose, out the mouth. Again. Now, take a moment to be present"
"Right here. Only here."

Reiterate that we are constantly learning.  Taking a minute to be mindful about learning.

(Holding large bowl & spoon) "Picture yourself in an ancient temple.  It's the first day of class and the monks are getting their first taste of their new menu: rice."

Request the 5 students to line up in front of the class.

Highlight the 3 students who are not ready to eat.

## Questions:
- What are the lessons from the first, upside down, bowl?
  - Ready to receive
- Hole?
  - Actively listening
- Dirty?
  - preconceived notions
- Do you see any other lessons here?
  - Responsibilities of person receiving rice.

## Closing:
Opportunities to learn are everywhere. They come in many forms. Even a simple rice bowl.

Possibly more important. Masters are everywhere.  You have mentors all around you. Even in (bow) your humble rice server.
